A Project made in first semester.

Project Description:
Create a basic command-line simulator for a kid's smartwatch that allows users to perform
activities that simulate the functions of a kid's smartwatch. You will create a simple commandline
smartwatch simulator that allows users to interact with a virtual mobile phone, perform
basic phone operations, and manage contacts. Additionally, it will provide basic watch
functions. This project will focus on user interaction and basic functionalities without the need
for complex data structures, file I/O, or arrays. You can only use basic variables (including
String) to store data, selection statements (if, else-if, switch), and basic while loops. You are not
allowed to use other structures, classes, or methods to implement the project.
Key Features:
1. User Interaction: Provide a text-based menu for users to interact with the virtual
smartwatch. Allow users to select and perform various activities.
2. Clock and Time: Implement a clock feature that displays the current time.
3. Stopwatch: Implement a stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionality.
4. Phone Functions: Implement basic mobile phone functions such as making calls, sending
text messages, and checking call logs. Kids can only communicate with people in their
contact lists.
5. Contact Management: Allow users to add, view, edit, and delete contact information (e.g.,
name and phone number).
6. Call Logs and Messages: Keep track of call logs and text messages within the simulator.
7. Games and Activities: Include a simple game that kids can engage with on the virtual
smartwatch such as a “Guess Number” game, a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” game, or a "Coin
Toss" game. Keep it as simple as possible (i.e. one-time, no loop structure). You can
implement any simple game.
8. User-Friendly Interface: Create a simple text-based menu system for users to access
different smartwatch's functions.
Technical Requirements:
1. Use Java for the project.
2. Implement a text-based user interface for interaction.
3. Use control structures such as selection statements and while loops to handle user input
and simulate the smartwatch's functions.
4. Utilize basic variables to store contacts, logs, messages, game scores, and user input
without using complex data structures (including arrays and ArrayLists).
Learning Opportunities:
This project will help beginners practice user input handling, control flow structures, and basic
loop structures while simulating the functionalities of a kid's smartwatch. It's a fun and creative
way to develop an understanding of program flow and user interfaces without involving
complex data structures, file I/O, or arrays.
